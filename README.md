**Student ID: 11348840**

This repository contains JavaScript functions relevant to React Native development. It includes solutions to the following tasks from Assignment 1:

**Task 1: Array Manipulation**

- The `arrayManipulation.js` file implements a function called `processArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with even numbers squared and odd numbers tripled.

**Task 2: String Formatting**

- The `arrayManipulation.js` file also includes a function named `formatArrayStrings` that takes two arrays: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on the corresponding number:
  - Uppercase for even numbers.
  - Lowercase for odd numbers.

**Task 3: User Profile Creation**

- The `userInfo.js` file contains a function named `createUserProfiles` that takes two arrays: an array of original names and an array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects containing original name, modified name, and an auto-incremented ID.
